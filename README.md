# Overview

The Java Typing Test is a command-line program that measures your typing speed and accuracy. It offers two modes: speed test and accuracy test. In the speed test, you will be prompted to type a passage "I'm a little teapot lyrics" as fast as possible. In the accuracy test, you will be given a series of words that get progressively harder to be type accurately.

## Features

- Speed Test: Type a passage as fast as possible and get your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- Accuracy Test: Type a series of words and receive a detailed accuracy report (# of correct words).


The program will display a menu with options to choose the type of test.

Enter 1 for the speed test or 2 for the accuracy test.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the chosen test.

After completing the test, your typing speed and accuracy will be displayed.
